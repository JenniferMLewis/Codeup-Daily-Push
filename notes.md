<h1> What is Data Science</h1>

<p>Formal Science: Math, Logic
Applied Science: Sociology, Stats, CS
Data: Digital Representation of information</p>
<br>
Ultimate goal: 
<ul>
<li>Provide actionable intelligence</li>
<li>via testable explanations<li>
<li>TAKE THE DATA, MAKE IT ACTIONABLE<li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Cartesian(sp) space is the area of a graph/grid you're working on.</p>
<br>
<h3>Myths</h3>
<p>Data Science == Statistics
Data Science == Business Analyst
Data Science == Data Science
<ul>
<li>Do not assume a common understanding to every hiring manager, recruiter and applicant</li>
</ul>
Data Science Curriculum is consistent across educators
If I want to be a data scientist, I just need to learn how to use R or Python
</p>
<h3>Vocab</h3>
<ul>
<li>ETL - Extract,Transform,Load</li>
<li>MVP - Minimum Viable Product</li>
<li>Statistical Analysis: Analyze telco customers who churn *(leave) vs. those who don't</li>
<li>Regression- Predict housing prices</li>
<li>Classicfication- predict who will survive the titanic,predict customers who will churn</li>
<li>Clustering-identify physical neighbourhoods, identify similar species</li>
<li>Time series analysis-forecast revenue, predict store item demand</li>
<li>Anomaly Detection-detect fraudulent transactions, account takeovers</li>
<li>NLP (Natural Language Processing)- SIRI, sentiment analysis, twitter bots, customer feedback</li>
<li>Distributed ML (Machine Learning)- Big data, Google search results, network log analysis</li>
<li>Graph Analysis- social networks, web analytics</li>
<li>Recommender Systems-netflix, amazon</li>
<li>Neural Networks/Deep Learning-image recognition, iPhone X face id</li>
</ul>


\\** WHAT LAMBDA DOES **\\
*\Key=Lambda x: x['price']  will return the ENTIRE dictionary reference based on code specification for the resulting 'price'
*\Can be affected with another value ex. Key=Lambda x: x['price'] * x['quantity'] will give the ENTIRE dictionary reference based on
*\the value of price * quantity (so total items sold).

Adding a little text for Git Exercise. Also I love that Git really does mean the slightly rude word, best way to name something after yourself!
