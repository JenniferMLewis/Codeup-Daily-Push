This is where I'll be keeping my notes I take throughout the course, as well as notes from book in the class library (Topics of books will usually be Python, PHP, and SQL, with some Java and communication skills).

Please feel free to look around, sometimes I played with random formatting code from HTML, so please just ignore that. Or paste it into a webpage to have cleaner notes.

Thank you and take care!
